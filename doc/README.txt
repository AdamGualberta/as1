This directory contains the agendron-FuelTrack app for submission with Assignment 1 in CMPUT301.

Overview:
This app is a simple fuel cost calculator app. One may input data into the text fields
and press add to add to an abstract array, which is stored in memory. At the same time,
the cost of fuel is calculated from the amount entered in L and the unit cost in cents/L and 
outputted to the screen.

Use:
This app has a main screen which contains text fields. The text fields have hints in them before
you start entering data.  Please follow the following conventions:
Date - YYYY-MM-DD
Station - any string, including whitespace
Odometer Reading - any integer
Fuel Grade - any string, including whitespace
Fuel Amount - any integer, note - calculation assumes Liters
Fuel Unit Cost - any integer, note - calculate assumes cents.

If a field is left blank, the app will crash. Exception handling will be implemented at a 
later date.

The "View Logs" button activates the activity meant for viewing a list of current logs, 
although has not been implemented.

This app is not yet persistent.

"# of Logs" shows the number of inputs so far (n+1).
